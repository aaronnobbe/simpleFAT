Project: simpleFAT
Aaron Nobbe

Description:

This project implements a simple FAT-like file system inside a single file, which allows one to create, add files, remove files, extract files, add directories, and list the contents of your file system.

Compiling:

In the option2 directory, run:

make

In order to produce the executable simplefat.


How to Use:


Create a new file system:

./simplefat -f myfs.simpleFAT -c


Add a directory:

./simplefat -f myfs.simpleFAT -d dirname


Add a file:

./simplefat -f myfs.simpleFAT -a filename.txt


List contents:

./simplefat -f myfs.simpleFAT -l


Extract a file:

./simplefat -f myfs.simpleFAT -e filename.txt > extracted.txt


Use diff to verify the extracted file matches the original:

diff filename.txt extracted.txt


Remove a file:

./simplefat -f myfs.simpleFAT -r filename.txt


List contents again (to confirm removal):

./simplefat -f myfs.simpleFAT -l


Testing:

Run the above commands in order. Use diff filename.txt extracted.txt to confirm extraction was done correctly and also verify additions and removals.

To clean use:

make clean

This will remove simplefat (implemented in makefile)
